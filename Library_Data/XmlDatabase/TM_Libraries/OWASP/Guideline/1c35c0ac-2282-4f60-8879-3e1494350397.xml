  <content>&lt;h1&gt;What to Do&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encrypt all authentication cookies and check their integrity before trusting them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unencrypted authentication cookies can be easily forged by attackers, allowing them to act as any user in the system.&amp;nbsp; Simply relying on the existence of an authentication cookie without checking its integrity and the correctness of the values it contains may allow an attacker to spoof an authentication cookie with garbage data, again being able to access the site when they should not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;When&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever authentication cookies are used, they should be encrypted and have their integrity checked each time they are used before trusting them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp;amp; practices guidance. &lt;/p&gt;</content>
