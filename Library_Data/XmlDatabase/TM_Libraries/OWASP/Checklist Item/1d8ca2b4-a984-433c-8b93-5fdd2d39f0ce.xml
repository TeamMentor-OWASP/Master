  <content>&lt;h1&gt;What to Check For&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that SSL is used when pages need to be encrypted and&amp;nbsp;to guarantee that the server to which you send the data is the server that you expect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;How to Fix&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using SSL is expensive. Use SSL only for pages that require it. This includes pages that contain or capture sensitive data, such as pages that accept credit card numbers and passwords. Use SSL only if the following conditions are true: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to encrypt the page data. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to guarantee that the server to which you send the data is the server that you expect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For pages where you must use SSL, follow these guidelines: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the page size as small as possible. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid using graphics that have large file sizes. If you use graphics, use graphics that have smaller file sizes and resolution, or use graphics from a site that is not secure. However, when you use graphics from a site that is not secure, some Web browsers may display a dialog box that asks the user if the user wants to display the content from the site that is not secure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp;amp; practices guidance. &lt;/p&gt;</content>
